        <h1>Of The Prismatic Garden</h1>
        <p>The Prismatic Garden is one of the legendary and mythical <i>'Black Books'</i> found within the region of East Anglia in the UK. It is one of many such books that formulate the fabled <i>'Secret Granary'</i> and the <i>'Nameless Arte'</i>. Within its pages can be found the Luciferian and mystical teachings of both the Witch and the Magician. It shares its name with one of the central concepts surrounding its teachings and the personal work undertaken by those that have discovered it. </p>
        <p>That is to say, that each practitioner has their universal dreamscape in the form of the <i>'Midnight Garden'</i>. This garden is pluralistic and ever-evolving in nature, proclaiming no word, aeon, token or sign as true. Within its walls can be found a plant, herb, tree, rock and structure for each spark of divine wisdom and knowledge at the disposal of its <i>'Guardian'</i>. Given time, the proper maintenance and due diligence, the Prismatic Garden will perpetually flourish and grow, nourishing the raw magical power of the awakened Pilgrim. It is, in fact, the cave of treasures and the oneiric reflection of the Arte Magical's Pantacle. Its sacred and fertile earth is watered by the holy cup of the Magician, which bares the devotional blood of the brotherhood. Without such, the garden would surely wither and die, becoming no more than an empty shell of meaningless veiled symbolism.</p>
        <p>The Watcher over this liminal space is known as the <i>'Eternal Gardner'</i>, who instructs the initiated in how to correctly plant, prune and place the prismatic array of infinite possibilities. For although any and all systems, traditions and praxis are permitted; the right conditions are often needed for them to unite in peace and harmony. With this, there is cross-pollination and the bringing forth of the gnostic revelation of an unexpected and unexplored nature. Within the essence of each plant, we find its luminary; its alchemical spirit, which teaches the crafts of the wise, to those who seek communion with them. It is both the realm of forms and that of fluidic evolution of a most contradictory and complementary mind-altering vision.</p>
        <p>The garden can be found through thorn and thicket, by lion and serpent. It lies in that place within the hedge, where daemons, mortals and monsters alike dance <i>'The Witches Sabbat'</i>. It is, in summary, the cauldron of inspiration into which the different traditions governed by the <i>'Lords of Light'</i> are merged, after crossing the rainbow bridge and seeing beyond the veil of veils. Many go in search of it, and the profane often misunderstands its writings to be literal. They are not, for its words are spoken in honour of the mighty nocturnal light of the forests.</p>
